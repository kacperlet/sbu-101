                        <p>The gender wage gap is a persistent societal issue affecting both men and women across diverse professions. Our mission is to actively address and raise awareness about the disparities in earnings between men and women, with a particular focus on the United States. Extending beyond, we are also dedicated to inspire action, influence policy changes, and contribute to a more just and equitable society for all.</p>

                        <p>The gender wage gap remains a critical problem in the United States, with women consistently earning less than their men for equal work, posing a significant barrier to achieving workplace equality. This enduring disparity not only hinders economic growth but also emphasizes the urgent need for strategies to address the underlying factors perpetuating unequal compensation. Closing the gap is essential for fostering workplace equity and empowering women in their professional pursuits.

                    <p class="frombelow">The gender wage gap, reflecting the disparity in incomes between men and women, has evolved over time in the United States, yet persistent challenges remain brought on by several factors on various levels. The contributing factors to the gender wage gap encompasses gender discrimination, occupational segregation, and societal expectations. </p>
                        
                    <p class="frombelow">These factors have consequences that span the workforce, society, and individual lives. They constrain women's access to higher-paying jobs, lower their earnings, and influence their career decisions. The workforce often sees an increased lack of diversity in leadership roles, contributing to gender-based occupational segregation. Society norms and expectations, influenced by gender inequality, may limit opportunities for women in various stages of life, extending beyond impacting women's personal assets and living conditions. </p>

                            <p>Gender wage gap is an ongoing problem in our society. As of 2022, for every dollar men made, women only made 78 cents. <a href="#source1" class="source">1</a></p>
                            <p>Why is that? Well, a large majority of women believe the reason for the wage gap between men and women is purely because of sexism; women being treated differently than men</p>
                            <p>Other women believe the issue lies in the role that women take in the household; caring for children, keeping the house in order, food shopping, etc. These women are unable to give jobs their full attention since they have a slew of other responsibilities that many men do not have, such as unpaid maternity leave</p>

                    <div class="image-text-combo">
                        <p>Regardless of the reason for the wage gap, women working full-time earned just 82% of men's earnings as of 2022. <a href="#source2" class="source">2</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Specifically, women CEOs and finance managers earned only 69% of what male CEOs and finance managers earned. Same title, same workload, very different paychecks. <a href="#source3" class="source">3</a></p>
                    <p>Men hold the majority of leadership positions due to women's household responsibilities distracting them and slowing (or completely halting) the process of “career progression”. Coupled with this is the bias, whether conscious or unconscious, towards women in leadership roles. <a href="#source4" class="source">4</a></p>
                    <h2>Why should the public care about the issue of gender wage gap?</h2>
                    <p>The wage gap between men and women is not something that affects each woman just once. It is an ongoing issue that takes a large toll on the lives of women, as they are earning a large percentage less than what men earn every day. It is proven that women are less likely to progress in their career than men are, leading more women to retire in poverty, a statistic that is constantly increasing. <a href="#source5" class="source">5</a></p>

                    <p>To get involved with this cause, we have conducted research on various organizations and protests dedicated to addressing the gender wage gap. Our plan involves reaching out to these organizations to explore collaboration opportunities, with the goal of jointly developing campaigns to raise awareness. Furthermore, we are considering perceiving past protests related to the gender wage gap, with the option of either supporting existing protests or organizing new protests. The overarching objective is to draw attention to this issue and educate individuals about the unequal pay women are facing for performing equivalent work compared to men.</p>
